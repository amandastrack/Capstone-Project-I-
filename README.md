# 1st Capstone Project #
## Playlist Creation Using Spotify Audio Features ##

### Problem ###
The right song can motivate you to run that extra mile or grind through that last chapter of studying. Thatâ€™s why people often have a playlist for different activities of their day. However, it can be time consuming to create these playlists. It requires sifting through many songs and then determining if it fits a certain category based on how it sounds and makes you feel. 

In this project we aim to use machine learning to classify songs into different categories. We will do this by exploring different audio features of a song and classifying which playlist category the song best fits into based on these features.

### Data ###
The data is extracted from the Spotify Web API (https://api.spotify.com). From the API we extract songs from different Workout, Focus, Party and Chill Playlists that are available on Spotify. We then extract another larger dataset of song audio feature details described here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/.

### Approach ###
*Apply data wrangling, exploratory data analysis & inferential statistics on the data set.
*Machine learning Techniques:  Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, XGBoost and Ensembling Method
